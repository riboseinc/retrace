# Retrace

NEWS: 2017-08-09: We are happy to announce the Retrace Challenge! See below!

`retrace` is a versatile security vulnerability / bug discovery tool
through monitoring and modifying the behavior of compiled binaries on
Linux, OpenBSD/FreeBSD/NetBSD (shared object) and macOS (dynamic library).

`retrace` can be used to assist reverse engineering / debugging
dynamically-linked ELF (Linux/OpenBSD/FreeBSD/NetBSD) and
Mach-O (macOS) binary executables.

# The Retrace Challenge + Rewards

Posted: 2017-08-09

We are happy to announce the Retrace Challenge!

The challenge is composed of three categories:

* Bug Challenge
* Improvement Challenge
* Usage Challenge

Our goal of the challenge is to:

* encourage security researchers to use `retrace` during their vulnerability assessment efforts;
* encourage developers to use `retrace` for code stability efforts; and
* make `retrace` more useful!

The main category is the "Bug Challenge": to find bugs (any bug AND security vulnerabilities)
in well-known software (OSS or proprietary) using `retrace`.


## Important Information

* Participation: anyone can participate
* Organizer: Ribose `retrace` team
* Eligibility period: From 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-10-10 00:00:00 (GMT) inclusive
* Results:
  * Winners will be announced on 2017-10-16 (GMT) on the same page as this announcement.
  * The selection of prizes will be determined solely by the organizer. We may not select winner(s) in a category if the quality of submissions is below our bottom line.
  * Reward amounts are in USD.
  * Winning challengers will receive their award via Amazon gift cards or PayPal transfer.

Please understand that while we aim to fully implement the spirit of fairness, in the case of any unresolved ambiguity or dispute, the organizer has the sole rights to make all decisions.


## The Bug Challenge

The Bug Challenge encourages finding bugs (any bug AND security vulnerabilities) in
well-known software (OSS / proprietary) using `retrace`.

### Eligibility

* The bug *MUST* be reported to the target software author AND the organizer during the "eligibility period". You must provide evidence to demonstrate this to the organizer (e.g., provide the public / private bug report).
* The bug will be eligible to the reward levels based on its CVE CVSS score.
* There is no absolute definition of "well-known software" -- it will be determined by the organizer -- please contact us to confirm prior to submission.
* Challenge submissions *ARE* allowed to be also submitted to other bounty programs under the condition that those bug reports *ALSO* fulfill our bug report eligibility requirements listed above. If a submission is discovered to be reported to other bounty programs that for example, do not mention `retrace`, it will be disqualified from our challenge.

### Eligibility Of Bug Report

* The bug report *MUST* be confirmed and accepted by the software author to be eligible for this challenge.
* The bug report *MUST*
  * Describe how `retrace` is used to discover / reproduce it
  * Include a link to `https://riboseinc.github.io/retrace/`
  * Mention "This submission is in response to the Ribose Retrace Challenge"

### CVE CVSS Score And Using retrace

* Critical: remote exploitable buffer overflows etc.
  * For example, can be discovered through Socket and File IO fuzzing (work in progress in retrace) or the `stringinject` utility.
* High: local exploitable buffer overflows etc.
  * For example, can be discovered through `getenv` fuzzing or the `stringinject` utility.
* Medium: severe crashes, buffer overflow etc.
  * Easy to discover using various retrace options, `stringinject`.
* Low: your average issues such as memory bugs.
  * Easy to discover using various retrace options, `stringinject`.

### Bug Challenge Rewards

Challenge rewards are given according to the CVE CVSS score of the entry:

* Critical: 1 grand prize of $1,000
* High: 2 prizes of $500
* Medium: 3 prizes of $200
* Low: a public name mention, the journey is the reward!

The `retrace` team will decide among all submissions of the same class (e.g., Medium, High), which discovered bugs would receive what prize, according to criteria derived from the following angles:

* Impact of the target software and impact of the bug in target software. We seek bugs that are more general in impact; rarely occuring bugs in obscure software will be de-prioritized.
* Creativity of retrace usage.

### Submitting To The Bug Challenge

Send an email to retrace@ribose.com with subject "Retrace Bug Challenge Submission" providing the following information:

1. Your particulars
  * Name (Title and Company if any)
  * Email

2. Bug details

# Building retrace

For platforms with Autotools, the generic way to build and install
`retrace` is:

``` console
$ sh autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-tests
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

You need Autotools installed in your system (`autoconf`, `automake`,
`libtool`, `make`, `gcc` packages).

OpenSSL library and headers are automatically detected, you can specify
an optional flag `--with-openssl=[PATH]` (to use a non-standard OpenSSL
installation root).

In order to build tests: run configure script with `--enable-tests`
flag.  To build cmocka tests you can specify an optional flag
`--with-cmocka=[PATH]` (to use a non-standard cmocka installation root).

By the default `retrace` is installed in `/usr/bin` directory.


# Running retrace

``` console
$ retrace [-f configuration file location] <executable>
```

Configuration file path can be set either in `RETRACE_CONFIG`
environment variable or by specifying `-f [path]` command line argument.


# Examples

## Trace usage example

In its most basic form `retrace` will just print all calls that are made
(and that are supported by retrace):

``` console
$ retrace /usr/bin/id
(2051) geteuid();
(2051) getuid();
(2051) getegid();
(2051) getgid();
(2051) fopen("/etc/passwd", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
uid=1000(test) gid=1000(test) groups=1000(test),10(wheel)
(2051) exit(0);
(2051) fileno(1);
(2051) fclose(1);
(2051) fileno(2);
(2051) fclose(2);
```

## Redirect usage example

The power of `retrace` lies its its ability to modify the behavior of
the standard system calls in a number of different ways.
This is done using a config file.

An easy example is redirecting the output of the `getuid()` call:

``` console
$ cat retrace.conf
getuid,0
geteuid,0
getegid,0
getgid,0

$ retrace -f retrace.conf /usr/bin/id
(4982) geteuid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getuid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getegid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getgid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) fopen("/etc/passwd", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
(4982) exit(0);
(4982) fileno(1);
(4982) fclose(1);
(4982) fileno(2);
(4982) fclose(2);
```


# Config Options

Other useful config file options are listed below.

## Connect

``` sh
connect,127.0.0.1,8080,192.168.1.110,9090
```

Will redirect a `connect()` call from `127.0.0.1:8080` to
`192.168.1.110:9090`.

## File-related

``` sh
fopen,/etc/passwd,/tmp/passwd
```

Will redirect a `fopen()` call from `/etc/passwd` to `/tmp/passwd`.

## Logging

``` sh
logtofile,retrace.log,1
```

Will send the log file to a file rather than `stderr`. You can configure
log output to write to `/dev/null` disable logging completely.

The second parameter indicates whether  we should flush the output after every
write. Disabling it (setting it to 0) has a considerable performace gain, but
runs the risk of losing the last part of the output if the program crashes.

``` sh
logperthread
```
This setting with no parameters, in combination with `logtofile`, will cause
one log to be written per every spawned process and thread. In this case the
path passed to logtofile will be used as the base for the file names, appening
the process id and thread id (only for non main threads).

## OpenSSL

``` sh
SSL_get_verify_result,10
```

Will cause the OpenSSL function `SSL_get_verify_result` to return any
desired value.

## Memory Fuzzing

``` sh
memoryfuzzing,0.05
```

This option will cause a percentage of `malloc()`, `realloc()` and
`calloc()` calls to fail.

The percentage is specified in a number (`float`) from `0` (no fail) to
`1` (all fail). This is useful to discover places in your code where you
are not checking the return value of allocators.

The seed of the random generator can be controlled with the
`fuzzingseed,1498729252` option, so that the results are repeatable.

## Incomplete I/O

``` sh
incompleteio,10
```

This option will cause the `read()` / `write()` calls to randomly
write/read less bytes than was asked. A common scenario that people
forget to check.

## Time tracking

``` sh
showtimestamp
showcalltime,0.0001
```

These two options will cause a timestamp (since the beginning of the
tracing) to be shown and the time a call took if it's larger than
the specified time in float seconds.

## Logging

``` sh
logging-global,LOG_GROUP_FILE|LOG_GROUP_MEM,RTR_LOG_LEVEL_ALL
logging-excluded-funcs,free|memcpy|malloc
logging-allowed-funcs,strlen
stacktrace-groups,LOG_GROUP_MEM
stacktrace-disabled-funcs,calloc
```

These options will enable or disable logging options by group or level.
The each group, level or function may be combined by `|` character.

``` sh
logging-global,[logging group],[logging level]
	groups: LOG_GROUP_ALL,LOG_GROUP_MEM,LOG_GROUP_FILE,LOG_GROUP_NET,LOG_GROUP_SYS,
		LOG_GROUP_STR,LOG_GROUP_SSL,LOG_GROUP_PROC
	levels: LOG_LEVEL_ALL,LOG_LEVEL_NOR,LOG_LEVEL_ERR,LOG_LEVEL_FUZZ,LOG_LEVEL_REDIRECT

logging-excluded-funcs,[functions list]
logging-allowed-funcs,[functions list]
stacktrace-groups,[logging groups]
stacktrace-disabled-funcs,[functions list]
```

## Data dump

``` sh
disabledatadump
```

By default `retrace` will dump the full buffers passed to functions such as `write()` and `read()`.
If this option (without parameters) is present, no buffers will be dumped. This can be useful to get
a cleaner output. It will even speed up the tracing if there are a lot of buffers are being printed.

# Notes

## macOS System Integrity Protection

We use the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES enviroment variable to insert `retrace` into binaries.
Starting on Mac OS X El Capitan Apple removes the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES variable for
the enviroment for binaries in system directories. This means you can't trace system binaries
using `retrace` by default.

You can disable this behaviour by running `csrutil disable` and rebooting.


# Feedback

`retrace` is under heavy development and we are always looking to implement new
and useful features that allows debugging and reverse engineering programs in
new and interesting ways.

Please send feedback and improvement suggestions either as GitHub issues or to
[retrace@ribose.com](mailto:retrace@ribose.com).
