# Introduction

`retrace` is versatile security vulnerability / bug discovery tool
through monitoring and modifying the behavior of compiled binaries on
Linux, OpenBSD/FreeBSD (shared object) and macOS (dynamic library).

`retrace` can be used to assist reverse engineering / debugging
dynamically-linked ELF (Linux/OpenBSD/FreeBSD) and Mach-O (macOS) binary
executables.

# Build Instructions

For platforms with Autotools, the generic way to build and install
`retrace` is:

``` sh
$ sh autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-tests
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

You need Autotools installed in your system (`autoconf`, `automake`,
`libtool`, `make`, `gcc` packages).

OpenSSL library and headers are automatically detected, you can specify
an optional flag `--with-openssl=[PATH]` (to use a non-standard OpenSSL
installation root).

In order to build tests: run configure script with `--enable-tests`
flag.  To build cmocka tests you can specify an optional flag
`--with-cmocka=[PATH]` (to use a non-standard cmocka installation root).


By the default `retrace` is installed in `/usr/bin` directory.

# Running retrace

``` sh
$ retrace [-f configuration file location] <executable>
```

Configuration file path can be set either in `RETRACE_CONFIG`
environment variable or by specifying `-f [path]` command line argument.


# Trace usage example

In its most basic form `retrace` will just print all calls that are made
(and that are supported by retrace):

``` sh
$ retrace /usr/bin/id
(2051) geteuid();
(2051) getuid();
(2051) getegid();
(2051) getgid();
(2051) fopen("/etc/passwd", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
(2051) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(2051) fclose(3);
uid=1000(test) gid=1000(test) groups=1000(test),10(wheel)
(2051) exit(0);
(2051) fileno(1);
(2051) fclose(1);
(2051) fileno(2);
(2051) fclose(2);
```

# Redirect usage example

The power of `retrace` lies its its ability to modify the behavior of
the standard system calls in a number of different ways.
This is done using a config file.

An easy example is redirecting the output of the `getuid()` call:

``` sh
$ cat retrace.conf
getuid,0
geteuid,0
getegid,0
getgid,0

$ retrace -f retrace.conf /usr/bin/id
(4982) geteuid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getuid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getegid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) getgid(); [redirection in effect: '0']
(4982) fopen("/etc/passwd", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
(4982) fopen("/etc/group", "rce"); [3]
(4982) fclose(3);
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
(4982) exit(0);
(4982) fileno(1);
(4982) fclose(1);
(4982) fileno(2);
(4982) fclose(2);
```

Other useful config file options are listed below.

## Connect

``` sh
connect,127.0.0.1,8080,192.168.1.110,9090
```

Will redirect a `connect()` call from `127.0.0.1:8080` to
`192.168.1.110:9090`.

## File-related

``` sh
fopen,/etc/passwd,/tmp/passwd
```

Will redirect a `fopen()` call from `/etc/passwd` to `/tmp/passwd`.

## Logging

``` sh
logtofile,retrace.log
```

Will send the log file to a file rather than `stderr`. You can configure
log output to write to `/dev/null` disable logging completely.

## OpenSSL

``` sh
SSL_get_verify_result,10
```

Will cause the OpenSSL function `SSL_get_verify_result` to return any
desired value.

## Memory Fuzzing

``` sh
memoryfuzzing,0.05
```

This option will cause a percentage of `malloc()`, `realloc()` and
`calloc()` calls to fail.

The percentage is specified in a number (`float`) from `0` (no fail) to
`1` (all fail). This is useful to discover places in your code where you
are not checking the return value of allocators.

The seed of the random generator can be controlled with the
`fuzzingseed,1498729252` option, so that the results are repeatable.

## Incomplete I/O

``` sh
incompleteio,10
```

This option will cause the `read()` / `write()` calls to randomly
write/read less bytes than was asked. A common scenario that people
forget to check.

## Time tracking

``` sh
showtimestamp
showcalltime,0.0001
```

These two options will cause a timestamp (since the beginning of the
tracing) to be shown and the time a call took if it's bigger than
the specified time in float seconds.
