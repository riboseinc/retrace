# dns-fuzz.sh: very crude DNS fuzzer for macOS using Retrace
#
# ONLY USE THIS CODE AS A REFERENCE, IT CONTAINS A HARDCODED NAMESERVER IP
# ADRESS AND HOSTNAME. IT IS NOT MEANT AS A STANDALONE FUZZING TOOL. YOU CAN USE
# IT FOR INSPIRATION AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW RETRACE CAN BE USED TO FUZZ
# NAMESERVERS.
#
# Dependencies:
# 1) the executable 'query' which can be compiled with: 'gcc query.c -o query'
# 2) gtimeout which can be installed with 'brew install coreutils'
#    macOS does not come with 'timeout' and Retrace might hang because of some
#    invalid DNS query
# 3) a functional nameserver (with a configured zone) that accepts queries
#    I installed NSD on Ubuntu for this purpose on VirtualBox
#
# query.c is nameserver query tool that uses sendto() making it a perfect
# example for Retrace string injection
#
# Inner workings and result:
# 1) Go through the entire hex space 0x00:0xff inserting a hex char at an offset
#    of the DNS query packet
# 2) Inject long strings (AAAAAA..) inserting at an offset of the DNS query
#    packet
# 3) Inject format strings (%s%s%s%s..) inserting at an offset of the DNS query
#    packet
#
# NOTE: THIS IMPLEMENTATION CURRENTLY ENLARGES THE DNS QUERY PACKET
#
# TODO:
# 1) Add zone transfer requests
# 2) Add DNSSEC operations
# 3) Replace query.c with actual nslookup and dig as these have much more
#    capabilities that can be used as fuzzing vehicles
